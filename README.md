Implementing a new way to get beautiful custom canvas videos for the ViviMusic app!

This repository acts as the central hub for mapping custom `.m3u8` videos to specific songs or albums within ViviMusic. Any changes you push to this repository are automatically deployed to our official hub: https://vivimusic-canvas.nfy.fyi. 

## How to add a new Canvas

If you find a cool visualizer or music video and want to display it in the background of ViviMusic whenever a specific song plays, follow these steps:

### 1. Upload your Video
Upload your `.m3u8` file into either the `Song/` or `Album/` directories within this repository. 
*Example: `Song/dracula_visualizer.m3u8`*

### 2. Update `canvas.json`
Open the `canvas.json` file located in the root of the repository. You will add a new block to the `"items"` array mapping the exact song name and artist to your new video URL.

Make sure your URL points to our deployed domain!

**Example:**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "song": "Song Title",
      "artist": "Artist Name",
      "url": "https://vivimusic-canvas.nfy.fyi/Song/your_video.m3u8"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Commit and Push
Once you have uploaded your video and updated `canvas.json`, simply commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When opening a **Pull Request**, please include the **original song/album link** (YouTube Music, Spotify, or similar) in the description. This helps us verify the metadata and ensure the canvas matches the correct track.

**Pull Request Example:**
> **Title:** `feat: added canvas for Blinding Lights by The Weeknd`
> **Description:**
> - Added `Song/20.m3u8`
> - Updated `canvas.json` mapping for "Blinding Lights"
> - **Original Link:** https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=4NRXx6U8ABQ

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added canvas for Song Title"
git push
```

That's it! Our deployment workflow will automatically redeploy your changes to the live site. The next time you play that song in ViviMusic, your custom video will automatically be fetched and looped in the background!

## Continuous Integration

To ensure the integrity of the `canvas.json` and prevent broken links, we have an automated **Validation Bot** that checks every Pull Request:

1.  **JSON Syntax**: Ensures the file is correctly formatted.
2.  **Schema Check**: Verifies that `song`, `artist`, and `url` fields are present for every entry.
3.  **Local File Check**: Verifies that the video file referenced in the URL actually exists in the `Song/` or `Album/` directory.
4.  **No Duplicates**: Ensures that no two entries have same (song, artist) combination.
5.  **Format Check**: Ensures URLs end in `.mp4` or `.m3u8`.

You can also run this check locally if you have Node.js installed:
```bash
node scripts/validate_canvas.js
```
